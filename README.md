# The free86 Operating System

This repository contains the source code of the **free86** operating system and its development environment.  
You can build a bootable floppy image of the system targeting x86 processors.  

The system has been tested on a 30386SX (1988, @16 MHz, 16 MiB address range) and a 80686 virtual machine, so most x86 CPUs should be compatible.  
Note that this project does not aim to run binaries from existing operating systems.

## Getting Started

To build the bootable floppy (kickstart image), you first need to compile the custom toolchain.  
A Makefile in the `Tools` directory automates this process. Increasing the number of parallel build jobs can drastically reduce the time needed to build the toolchain, so I highly recommend it. The GNU toolchain is not particularly small, and this tiny tweak can mean a difference between a cigarette break and a leisurely dinner. However, it is not strictly necessary.

```makefile
# File: Tools/Makefile

# Configure the amount of parallel jobs here
export MAKEFLAGS += -j4

# For example:
# export MAKEFLAGS += -j12
```

To start building, fire up a terminal, switch to the `Tools` directory and run `make`.

```bash
cd Tools
make
```

This will take a while, so feel free to grab a coffee.
After the toolchain is built, you can create and run the floppy image with QEMU from within the Source directory.

```bash
cd Source
make run-qemu
```

## Documentation

If you want to tinker with system yourself, I strongly recommended you give the [handbook](./Docs/Manual/README.md) a try. It's not always 100% complete, but I do my best to keep it up to date.
