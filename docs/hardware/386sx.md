- **Paging support** for virtual memory management.
- **Real Mode** for compatibility with 16-bit software.
- **Virtual 8086 Mode** for running 16-bit applications in a protected environment.
- **Hardware multitasking support** through the use of a Task State Segment (TSS).

## 2. Processor Registers

### 2.1. General-Purpose Registers (GPRs)

These registers are used for arithmetic, logical operations, data manipulation, and memory access. Each GPR can be accessed as 32-bit, 16-bit, or 8-bit registers.

| **Register** | **Purpose**                                  | **Notes**                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **EAX**      | Accumulator Register                         | Used in arithmetic and logical operations, especially `mul` and `div`. |
| **EBX**      | Base Register                                | Often used as a base pointer for memory addresses.          |
| **ECX**      | Count Register                               | Used for loop counters, `rep` instructions, and shifts/rotations. |
| **EDX**      | Data Register                                | Used in division and multiplication operations, I/O port access. |
| **ESI**      | Source Index Register                        | Points to the source in string operations.                  |
| **EDI**      | Destination Index Register                   | Points to the destination in string operations.             |
| **ESP**      | Stack Pointer                                | Points to the current top of the stack. Used in push/pop and function calls. |
| **EBP**      | Base Pointer                                 | Used to reference local variables in stack frames during function calls. |

#### 16-bit and 8-bit Access:
Each 32-bit general-purpose register can be split into lower 16-bit registers and further into 8-bit registers.

- **16-bit access**: `AX`, `BX`, `CX`, `DX`, `SI`, `DI`, `SP`, `BP`
- **8-bit access**: `AL` (lower byte of `AX`), `AH` (upper byte of `AX`), `BL`, `BH`, `CL`, `CH`, `DL`, `DH`

For example:
- `EAX` → 32-bit
- `AX` → 16-bit (lower half of `EAX`)
- `AL` and `AH` → 8-bit (lower and upper halves of `AX`)

### 2.2. Segment Registers

Segment registers store the base addresses of memory segments. In both real and protected mode, they are used in combination with an offset to calculate the effective memory address.

| **Register** | **Purpose**                                  | **Notes**                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CS**       | Code Segment                                 | Points to the segment containing the code being executed.   |
| **DS**       | Data Segment                                 | Points to the segment containing data.                      |
| **SS**       | Stack Segment                                | Points to the segment containing the stack.                 |
| **ES**       | Extra Segment                                | Additional segment, often used in string operations.        |
| **FS**       | Extra Segment                                | Another data segment, useful for different parts of the program. |
| **GS**       | Extra Segment                                | Additional segment register, similar to `FS`.               |

Segment registers are used to form **logical addresses** by combining the segment base with an offset. In **protected mode**, segment registers contain selectors that point to **segment descriptors** in the **Global Descriptor Table (GDT)** or **Local Descriptor Table (LDT)**.

### 2.3. Control Registers

Control registers are used to manage the CPU's operating modes, such as enabling protected mode, paging, and floating-point error handling. These registers are critical to configuring the processor’s behavior and should be modified with caution, as incorrect settings can lead to system crashes or undefined behavior.

| **Register** | **Purpose**                                  | **Notes**                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CR0**      | Main Control Register                        | Controls important CPU modes such as protected mode and paging. |
| **CR1**      | Reserved                                     | Unused by the 80386SX.                                      |
| **CR2**      | Page Fault Linear Address                    | Holds the address that caused a page fault.                 |
| **CR3**      | Page Directory Base Register                 | Holds the physical address of the page directory for paging. |

#### CR0 Bit Fields

The **CR0** register is crucial in controlling how the CPU operates. Each bit configures a specific aspect of the processor's behavior. Changing any bit in **CR0** can significantly affect system stability, so updates should be done only when necessary and with a clear understanding of the bit's function.

| **Bit** | **Name**              | **Description** |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **0**  | **PE (Protection Enable)** | Enables **Protected Mode** when set to 1. When set, the CPU transitions from **Real Mode** to **Protected Mode**, enabling memory segmentation and hardware-level protection. A system reset or specific exit commands are needed to switch back to real mode. |
| **1**  | **MP (Monitor Coprocessor)** | Controls how the CPU handles the **WAIT** instruction. When set, it enables the CPU to monitor the **TS** (Task Switched) flag in the **EFLAGS** register, ensuring proper behavior when a floating-point coprocessor is in use. |
| **2**  | **EM (Emulation)**          | When set, **EM** forces all floating-point instructions to generate an exception, effectively disabling the floating-point unit (FPU). This is used for systems that don't have an FPU and want to rely on software emulation instead. |
| **3**  | **TS (Task Switched)**      | Indicates a task switch has occurred. When set, the **TS** bit signals that the next floating-point instruction will generate an exception if necessary. It’s used in task management and should not be manually modified during normal operations. |
| **4**  | **ET (Extension Type)**     | Indicates the type of FPU present. If set to 1, the system has an **80387** FPU. If set to 0, it has an older **80287** FPU. This bit is read-only and is set during system initialization based on the detected hardware. |
| **5**  | **NE (Numeric Error Enable)** | Enables the standard mechanism for floating-point exception handling. When set, the processor uses the **INT 16** interrupt to handle floating-point errors. This bit must be set to ensure correct exception handling in modern systems. |
| **16** | **WP (Write Protect)**      | Controls whether supervisor-level code can write to read-only pages when paging is enabled. When set to 1, write protection applies to all levels of access, including ring 0. This bit enhances memory protection, especially in multitasking environments. |
| **18** | **AM (Alignment Mask)**     | When set, alignment checking is enabled if the **AC** flag in the **EFLAGS** register is also set. This is used to detect unaligned memory accesses, which can lead to performance penalties or, in some cases, hardware exceptions. |
| **29** | **NW (Not Write-through)**  | When set, disables write-through caching for pages mapped as write-back in the paging system. It affects how the cache handles data writes, with potential performance impacts in systems that heavily rely on caching mechanisms. |
| **30** | **CD (Cache Disable)**      | When set, disables all data and instruction caching. This bit is typically set during system initialization or debugging but can severely degrade system performance if left enabled during normal operation. |
| **31** | **PG (Paging Enable)**      | Enables paging when set to 1. This is necessary for implementing virtual memory. The **CR3** register must be configured with a valid page directory before setting this bit. Incorrect configuration can lead to immediate system crashes due to invalid memory accesses. |

#### Performing Changes to CR0

Altering **CR0** requires caution because it directly controls critical processor features like **Protected Mode**, **Paging**, and **Floating-point operations**. For example:

- **Enabling Protected Mode** (`PE` bit): This requires setting up the **Global Descriptor Table (GDT)** properly beforehand. Failing to configure the GDT correctly before enabling **PE** can lead to system crashes or lockups.
- **Enabling Paging** (`PG` bit): Paging should only be enabled after the **CR3** register is set up with a valid page directory. Incorrect page directory setup can cause page faults and system instability.
- **Disabling the Cache** (`CD` bit): While useful for debugging, disabling caching can severely affect performance and should only be used temporarily.

##### Correct Procedure for Changing CR0:
1. **Save the current system state**: Back up important data or register values before making changes.
2. **Set up prerequisites**: Ensure all required structures (e.g., GDT for Protected Mode, page directory for Paging) are properly configured.
3. **Modify the CR0 register**: Write the new value to **CR0**. This is typically done in assembly language using the `mov` instruction.
4. **Verify the system state**: After the change, check that the system behaves as expected, especially for complex changes like enabling paging or protected mode.

Changing **CR0** is a significant operation that can alter how the processor interacts with memory and handles tasks. Any change must be done with a thorough understanding of the current system configuration and potential consequences.

### 2.4. Debug Registers

The **Intel 80386SX** provides a set of debug registers that allow hardware-level debugging by setting breakpoints on specific memory addresses or ranges. These registers are useful for tracking specific memory accesses, such as reads, writes, or code execution at defined locations. The **Debug Registers** are critical in low-level development, providing the ability to monitor the execution of programs and detect issues in real-time.

The debug registers include **DR0** to **DR3** for holding breakpoint addresses, **DR6** for status reporting, and **DR7** for control and configuration of the breakpoints.

| **Register** | **Purpose**                                  | **Notes**                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DR0**      | Debug Address Register 0                     | Holds the linear address for the first hardware breakpoint. |
| **DR1**      | Debug Address Register 1                     | Holds the linear address for the second hardware breakpoint. |
| **DR2**      | Debug Address Register 2                     | Holds the linear address for the third hardware breakpoint. |
| **DR3**      | Debug Address Register 3                     | Holds the linear address for the fourth hardware breakpoint. |
| **DR6**      | Debug Status Register                        | Holds the status of the debug conditions once a breakpoint has been triggered. |
| **DR7**      | Debug Control Register                       | Configures and enables the breakpoints. Controls the type of access that triggers the breakpoints (read, write, or execute). |

#### DR0–DR3: Breakpoint Address Registers

The **DR0–DR3** registers hold the **linear addresses** where hardware breakpoints are set. Each of these registers corresponds to one of the four available hardware breakpoints. When the CPU accesses a memory location that matches the address in any of these registers, a breakpoint exception (Interrupt 1) is triggered, allowing the system to pause execution and examine the state of the processor and memory.

**Linear Address**: The address stored in each of these registers is a linear address, which means it is not affected by segmentation. Paging must be considered if it is enabled, as the linear address will still be translated to a physical address.

#### DR6: Debug Status Register

The **DR6** register is read by the CPU when a debug exception occurs, and it provides information about which breakpoint was hit. This register helps determine the source of the breakpoint and whether the exception was caused by a watchpoint or some other condition.

| **Bit** | **Name**                 | **Description** |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **0**  | **B0 (Breakpoint 0)**     | Set to 1 if breakpoint 0 (set in **DR0**) is triggered. |
| **1**  | **B1 (Breakpoint 1)**     | Set to 1 if breakpoint 1 (set in **DR1**) is triggered. |
| **2**  | **B2 (Breakpoint 2)**     | Set to 1 if breakpoint 2 (set in **DR2**) is triggered. |
| **3**  | **B3 (Breakpoint 3)**     | Set to 1 if breakpoint 3 (set in **DR3**) is triggered. |
| **13** | **BD (Debug Register Access Detected)** | Set to 1 if there was an attempt to read or write a debug register while the **GD (General Detect)** flag in **DR7** is set. This condition is used for security, ensuring debug registers are not accessed unexpectedly. |
| **14** | **BS (Single Step)**      | Set to 1 if a single-step trap occurred (similar to setting the **TF** bit in **EFLAGS**). |
| **15** | **BT (Task Switch)**      | Set to 1 if a task switch caused the debug exception. |

These status flags are cleared after the CPU handles the exception. For example, if **B0** is set, it indicates that breakpoint 0 (set in **DR0**) has been triggered.

#### DR7: Debug Control Register

The **DR7** register controls the behavior of the hardware breakpoints. It allows you to configure the type of access (read, write, or execute) that triggers a breakpoint and enables or disables individual breakpoints. It also controls whether breakpoints apply to all privilege levels or only to certain levels (e.g., user mode vs. kernel mode).

| **Bit**  | **Name**                    | **Description** |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **0**   | **L0 (Local Breakpoint 0)**  | Enables breakpoint 0 for the current task when set to 1. |
| **1**   | **G0 (Global Breakpoint 0)** | Enables breakpoint 0 for all tasks when set to 1. |
| **2**   | **L1 (Local Breakpoint 1)**  | Enables breakpoint 1 for the current task when set to 1. |
| **3**   | **G1 (Global Breakpoint 1)** | Enables breakpoint 1 for all tasks when set to 1. |
| **4**   | **L2 (Local Breakpoint 2)**  | Enables breakpoint 2 for the current task when set to 1. |
| **5**   | **G2 (Global Breakpoint 2)** | Enables breakpoint 2 for all tasks when set to 1. |
| **6**   | **L3 (Local Breakpoint 3)**  | Enables breakpoint 3 for the current task when set to 1. |
| **7**   | **G3 (Global Breakpoint 3)** | Enables breakpoint 3 for all tasks when set to 1. |
| **8-9** | **LE (Local Exact Breakpoint Enable)** | When set, enables exact breakpoint matching for all local breakpoints. |
| **10-11** | **GE (Global Exact Breakpoint Enable)** | When set, enables exact breakpoint matching for all global breakpoints. |
| **12-13** | **RW0** | Specifies the type of access that triggers breakpoint 0 (00 = execute, 01 = write, 10 = I/O, 11 = read/write). |
| **14-15** | **LEN0** | Specifies the size of the memory area to watch for breakpoint 0 (00 = 1 byte, 01 = 2 bytes, 10 = 8 bytes). Similar fields are available for other breakpoints (RW1, RW2, RW3). |
| **16**  | **GD (General Detect)**      | When set, causes an exception when any debug register is accessed. This is useful for preventing unauthorized manipulation of the debug registers. |

By setting the appropriate bits in **DR7**, you can configure each breakpoint individually to trigger based on access type (read, write, or execute) and specify whether the breakpoint applies globally or just to the current task.


### 2.5. Task Register (TR)

The **Task Register (TR)** points to the current **Task State Segment (TSS)**, which holds information about a task’s state during a context switch in multitasking environments.

- **TR**: Holds a selector that points to the TSS descriptor in the GDT or LDT.
- The TSS contains information like register states, I/O permissions, and the processor's privilege level for each task.

### 2.6. Flags Register (EFLAGS)

The **EFLAGS** register contains various status flags, control flags, and system flags that provide information about the current state of the processor or control the flow of execution. It’s divided into three main sections: status flags, control flags, and system flags.

#### Important Flags in EFLAGS:

| **Flag**        | **Bit** | **Purpose** |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| **CF (Carry Flag)**     | 0       | Set if an arithmetic operation generates a carry or borrow. |
| **PF (Parity Flag)**    | 2       | Set if the number of set bits in the least significant byte of the result is even. |
| **AF (Auxiliary Carry Flag)** | 4 | Set if there is a carry from or borrow to the lower nibble. |
| **ZF (Zero Flag)**      | 6       | Set if the result of an operation is zero. |
| **SF (Sign Flag)**      | 7       | Set if the result of an operation is negative. |
| **OF (Overflow Flag)**  | 11      | Set if the result of an arithmetic operation overflows. |
| **DF (Direction Flag)** | 10      | Controls the direction of string operations (increment or decrement). |
| **IF (Interrupt Flag)** | 9       | Controls whether maskable interrupts are enabled. |
| **TF (Trap Flag)**      | 8       | Enables single-step mode for debugging. |
| **IOPL (I/O Privilege Level)** | 12–13 | Sets the I/O privilege level required to access I/O ports. |
| **NT (Nested Task Flag)** | 14 | Set if the processor is in a nested task. |
| **RF (Resume Flag)**    | 16      | Prevents debugging traps from being triggered after a debug exception. |
| **VM (Virtual 8086 Mode)** | 17 | When set, enables Virtual 8086 mode. |
| **AC (Alignment Check)** | 18 | Enables alignment checking of memory accesses. |

### 2.7. Test Registers (TR)

The 80386SX includes **test registers** that are used for testing and debugging purposes.

| **Register**  | **Purpose**                                  | **Notes**                                                   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TR6**       | Test Control Register                        | Used for testing memory caches and page directory entries.   |
| **TR7**       | Test Status Register                         | Reports status on memory caches and page faults.             |

## 3. Processor Features and Hardware-Level Functions

### 3.1. Protected Mode

In **Protected Mode**, the processor can use 32-bit addressing and provides memory protection features through segmentation and paging. Key capabilities include:

- **Memory segmentation**: Segments have base addresses, limits, and access rights, allowing programs to be isolated from each other.
- **Hardware-level multitasking**: The processor can switch between tasks using the **Task State Segment (TSS)**.
- **Paging**: Enables virtual memory, where memory is divided into pages and managed dynamically.

### 3.2. Paging

Paging divides memory into **4 KB pages** and maps virtual memory addresses to physical addresses using **page tables**. This feature allows:

- **Virtual memory management**: Programs can use more memory than physically available by swapping pages to and from disk.
- **Memory protection**: Each page can have its own access rights (read, write, execute).

### 3.3. Real Mode

**Real Mode** is backward compatible with the 16-bit 8086/8088 architecture, allowing direct access to 1 MiB of memory without any memory protection.

### 3.4. Virtual 8086 Mode

**Virtual 8086 Mode** enables the execution of 16-bit real mode applications in a protected environment. While in this mode, paging can be used to isolate 16-bit applications from each other and the system.

### 3.5. Task Switching

Task switching is supported through the **Task State Segment (TSS)**, which stores the state of the current task (registers, flags, etc.) and allows the processor to switch between tasks efficiently.

## 4. Processor Features That Can Be Enabled

### 4.1. Enabling Protected Mode

Protected Mode is activated by setting the **PE (Protection Enable)** bit in **CR0**. Afterward, the system must configure the **Global Descriptor Table (GDT)**, which defines the base addresses, limits, and permissions for memory segments.

### 4.2. Enabling Paging

Paging is enabled by setting the **PG (Paging Enable)** bit in **CR0**. Before enabling paging, you must configure the **page directory** and **page tables**.

### 4.3. Enabling Hardware Breakpoints

Hardware breakpoints are configured using the **DR0–DR3** registers to specify the memory addresses to watch. **DR7** controls the activation of breakpoints and their types (e.g., read, write, execute).
